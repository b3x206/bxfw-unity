Personal tools for easier game development / prototyping / or just normal development.

It may contain half-baked scripts for the time being, but at the beta-ish release everything will be tested and be working (i hope).

The code is &lt;summary/&gt; ified, basically what the code does is in the code file (which is not docs, but as soon as i feel like adding `docfx` as github pages it will be slightly better, i don't want to write docs one by one).

* Supported version(s) : `2021.3` or higher. Only LTS versions are supported

## How to use : 
* Clone using ```$ git clone https://github.com/b3x206/bxfw-unity.git``` to desired directory (somewhere inside Assets folder, it has to be inside Assets). (Or download the zip of source code)
* To clone into a folder with different name just add a name argument like ```$ <git command for clone> desired_folder_name```.
* If you want to use the most updated branch, either specify the branch like ```$ git clone --branch main https://github.com/b3x206/bxfw-unity.git```

## Problem / Bug? :
* Create an issue about the problem with the offending files / minimal repro files (or instructions) and a concise description.
* Or try to solve in this undocumented one hell of a codebase and if you succeed open PR
