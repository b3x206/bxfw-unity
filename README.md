Some useful stuff.
Contains certain utilites for problems and makes development 'easier' (for me, this is very personal and absolutely not documented).

## How to use : 
* NOTE : For the time being, clone the nightly branch as the stable 'master' branch is out of date.
* Once the 'nightly' branch is complete, it will be merged.
* Clone using ```git clone -b nightly https://github.com/b3x206/bxfw-unity.git ``` for now. (Or download the zip of the 'nightly' branch)

## Problem / Bug? :
* idk create issue i guess
